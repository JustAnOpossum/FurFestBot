# Midwest FurFest Countdown Bot
This is a bot that I made, it counts down the days until MFF in the form of a picture.

# Language
The bot was coded in Node.js

# Where to find my bot?

# How to run?

If you want to run it for a different convention, or whatever else. Download the repository, then run
```
npm install
```
Edit the private folder and put your own keys in. Then go into **pic.js** and change MFF to whatever con you want. Edit **urls.js** with the images and video URLs you want to use to generate the images. Put images inside the folder labeled **mff**. Finaly edit main.js and replace the names for the bots responses and whatever you see fit to do.
